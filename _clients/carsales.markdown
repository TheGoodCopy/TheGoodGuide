# **Carsales style sheet**

---\
VOICE AND TONE\

Be conversational. Say it how you'd literally say it. Pick up on slang and colloquial language, and don't be afraid to use language or terms that car enthusiasts, mechanics use – as long as it's understandable in context.

Audience\
\[GET HELP – SPLIT BLOG AND FACEBOOK\] Car enthusiasts, younger drivers

---\
FORMATTING\

CAPITALS\
Brand names\
Go with the brand. Stick with their vanity capitals.

Capitalise school years unless they're plural. And use numerals.\
	Mia's in Grade 5.\
	I completed Year 12 in 2002.\
	Throughout years 10 and 11

Car names\
\[EXPAND\] Go with the brand. Stick with their vanity capitals.\

PUNCTUATION\
---\
APOSTROPHES\
Use curly, not straight, on blog posts.

Use straight, not curly, on Facebook captions – platform default.

EMOJI\
These can be used instead of full stops at the end of captions.\
If an emoji comes at the start of a sentence and is working as a word, the word following it continues in lower-case (so, no initial capital).

FULL STOPS\
Don't use full stops in acronyms and initialisms.\
	You only get AM now.

No full stops at end of Facebook captions, even after two or three sentences.

DASHES\
Spaced ens for textual dashes. Both platforms – blog and Facebook.

QUOTATION MARKS\
Use curly, not straight, on blog posts.

Use straight, not curly, on Facebook captions – platform default.

Use doubles for all direct speech – things that people have written or said. Use singles for anything being defined or flagged as a special term.
