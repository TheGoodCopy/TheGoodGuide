## Style sheet

### Blog posts and Facebook captions

**Voice and tone**

We‚Äôre conversational. We write how we talk. We pick up on slang and colloquial language, and we aren‚Äôt afraid to use language or terms that vintage-car lovers, mechanics or revheads use ‚Äì as long as it‚Äôs understandable in context.

We‚Äôre a ‚Äòwe‚Äô.

We treat car companies as singular entities, even if their Facebook handle is pluralised.\
Has @HondaAustraliaCars transformed the ever safe and reliable Civic into something more?\
not\
Have @Honda AustralianCars transformed the ever safe and reliable Civic into something more?

That said, we can swap into the plural in a new sentence ‚Äì but never within the same sentence.\
Can Uber deliver autonomous flying taxis by 2020? Or are they just distracting us from their recent controversies?

We refer to the people we‚Äôre writing about (e.g., in Carpool blog posts) by their first names, not their surnames. It‚Äôs friendlier. Just make sure the name makes sense in the context.

*Audience*

Our audience is a ‚Äòyou‚Äô, and we use the imperative mood to talk to them.\
Somehow we managed to trim our list to just five. What scenes would make the cut in yours?

**Formatting**

*Capitalisation*

In general, we prefer a minimalist approach to capitalisation.

We use min caps for Facebook link headlines ‚Äì except when a Carpool category forms part of it.

In Facebook captions, advice and news articles don‚Äôt get a subtitle in the link headline ‚Äì i.e., they don‚Äôt have a colon with ‚ÄòNews‚Äô or ‚ÄòAdvice‚Äô before it. Just write these link headlines as one sentence in min caps, aka sentence case.

*Blog posts*\
We use max caps to format all titles of blog categories. After colons, we use min caps ‚Äì that is, we treat the subtitle as a sentence, capitalising only the first letter of the first word and any proper noun. Don‚Äôt add a full stop.\
Old School: Ten facts about John Lennon‚Äôs Rolls-Royce

We use min caps for any subtitles within the post. These don‚Äôt take full stops.

*Brand and car model names*\
We respect the brand and roll with their vanity capitals, as well as any odd punctuation styling they want to use.

Write the brand name first, and then the model name. When you‚Äôre adding a model year for the first time (or when you‚Äôre writing it as a title ‚Äì¬†as in, when it‚Äôs acting as the official name of the car), write the model year before both the brand and model names. But you can change this up in captions or subsequent instances to fit the flow of your sentence.\

*Other uses for capitals*\
We capitalise names of Carpool collections, including the word Collection (unless it‚Äôs plural).\
Spoil someone (or yourself) this Valentine‚Äôs Day with one of these beautiful rides from our Romantic Drives Collection\
\
But note that we wouldn‚Äôt capitalise these words if they weren‚Äôt acting as the name of the collection.\
We love these six romantic drives

Capitalise school years, unless they‚Äôre plural. And use digits, not words.\
Mia‚Äôs in Grade 5.\
Throughout years 10 and 11

Capitalise names of car games ‚Äì as if they‚Äôre titles.\
Punch Buggy\
I Spy

*Emoji*

We can use emoji in captions. We just don‚Äôt overdo it.

If an emoji comes at the end of a caption, just let it sit at the end without any other punctuation. See **Punctuation:** *Full stops* for more info about using full stops at the end of captions. (Hint: We don‚Äôt use them if the caption is only one sentence.)

If an emoji comes at the start of a sentence and is working as a word, the word following it continues in lower-case (so, with no initial capital).

If you‚Äôre putting an emoji between two sentences in a caption, it replaces the terminating mark of the first sentence. Start the second sentence with a capital letter.\
You‚Äôll appreciate that it won‚Äôt depreciate (as much) ü§î Here‚Äôs our guide to buying a used 2008‚Äì13 @SKODAAustralia Octavia

An emoji can replace a word (or come between two words) in the middle of a sentence, and we don‚Äôt put punctuation around it. In this way, it‚Äôs conveying a feeling or standing in for a word in the middle of other words, so we treat it as another word. Just don‚Äôt overdo it.\
Give us a ‚ù§Ô∏è for the bush and a üëç for the city.

*Facebook captions*

Link headlines need to be short.

For articles that contain videos (not standalone Facebook videos), format the headline like this:\
Video: Our advice on how to tackle steep terrain

*Numbers*

Spell out numbers to nine and use numerals for 10 and up.\
Somehow we managed to cut this list to just five.\
With all those fire signs currently 90 degrees to the left of you\
Watch our 60-second test\
of the 20th century

Add commas to numbers of four numerals or more.\
Of those, only 3,500 were bought by women.

Use numerals when referring to currency, either colloquially or formally.\
You want 20 bucks?\
That‚Äôs $4.95, for you.

Use numerals for specific times of day. Use a full stop to separate hours and minutes, not a colon, and sit the lower-case time unit flush at the end. Write out times when you‚Äôre using a term or phrase such as ‚Äòo‚Äôclock‚Äô, ‚Äòin the morning‚Äô or ‚Äòhalf past‚Äô.\
4\.30am\
That‚Äôs not what you want to hear at two in the morning.\
Meet us at half past one.

Use Australian date style.\
Then, on 11 March 1957, the Meadows Frisky was announced to the public

Spans of model years take the century on first instance and then only two digits of the year (unless the span crosses centuries: 1998‚Äì2002). The year span usually sits before a brand and model name. It only sits after if the span is in brackets (and this normally only happens in the blog titles, which we don‚Äôt write, or the Facebook post leads that basically follow said blog titles).\

Review: 2017 Skoda Octavia RS

Use numerals to show decades, rather than spelling them out, and use an apostrophe to show the missing century. Show that the decade is plural by adding the letter *s*.\
Powerful compacts were all the rage in the ‚Äô60s\
the 1890s, the ‚Äô90s

Spell out units of measurement, but use numerals. Break this rule (i.e., use abbreviations) when you‚Äôre dealing with a lot of numbers in one section.\
Weighing in at 15 kilograms \*not \*Weighing in at 15kg\
heated to 70 degrees Celsius

*Tagging*

Tag Australian car brands wherever possible. Tag the international brand if an Australian one isn‚Äôt available.

**Punctuation**

*Apostrophes*

Submit all blog post copy with curly apostrophes, not straight.

But use straight apostrophes, not curly, in Facebook captions. They‚Äôre the platform‚Äôs default, so we may as well work with it.

*Colons*

In Facebook caption link headlines, use a colon to separate category titles from subtitles. Don‚Äôt capitalise the first word after the colon‚Äîexcept in reviews, which are mostly car and brand names, anyway.\

Review: 2017 Suzuki Swift\
Review: Top five cheap turbo cars you'll want to drive

*Ellipses*

On Facebook, use three full stops (which is easier than copying and pasting the glyph all the time). Don‚Äôt add a space before it, but add a space after.\
All they have to do now is automate the getting-petrol-into-the-tank part‚Ä¶

*Exclamation marks*\
Only use for true exclamations.

*Full stops*

We don‚Äôt use full stops in a Facebook caption if it is one single sentence. We only add them if the caption has two or more sentences.

Don‚Äôt use full stops in acronyms and initialisms.\
You only get AM on the car radio now.\
Over in the US

*Dashes*

Use spaced en dashes for textual dashes ‚Äì in blog posts and in Facebook captions.

*Quotation marks*

Use curly quotation marks, not straight, in blog posts.

Use straight quotation marks, not curly, in Facebook captions. They‚Äôre the platform‚Äôs default, so we may as well work with it.

Use double quotation marks for all direct speech ‚Äì that is, anything someone has written or said.

Use single quotation marks for anything being defined or flagged as a special term. Don‚Äôt overdo this, though, or else we stray into scare quote territory.
