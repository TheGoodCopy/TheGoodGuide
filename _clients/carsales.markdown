## Style sheet

### Blog posts and Facebook captions

**Voice and tone**

We‚Äôre conversational. We write how we talk. We pick up on slang and colloquial language, and we aren‚Äôt afraid to use language or terms that vintage-car lovers, mechanics or revheads use ‚Äì as long as it‚Äôs understandable in context.

We‚Äôre a ‚Äòwe‚Äô.

We treat car companies as singular entities, even if their Facebook handle is pluralised.\

*Audience*

Our audience is a ‚Äòyou‚Äô, and we use the imperative mood to talk to them.\
Somehow we managed to trim our list to just five. What scenes would make the cut in yours?

**Formatting**

*Capitalisation*

In general, we prefer a minimalist approach to capitalisation.

We use min caps for Facebook link headlines.

*Brand and car model names*\
We respect the brand and roll with their vanity capitals, as well as any odd punctuation styling they want to use.

Write the brand name first, and then the model name. When you‚Äôre adding a model year for the first time (or when you‚Äôre writing it as a title ‚Äì¬†as in, when it‚Äôs acting as the official name of the car), write the model year before both the brand and model names. But you can change this up in captions or subsequent instances to fit the flow of your sentence.\

*Other uses for capitals*\
We capitalise names of Carpool collections, including the word Collection (unless it‚Äôs plural).\

\
But note that we wouldn‚Äôt capitalise these words if they weren‚Äôt acting as the name of the collection.\
We love these six romantic drives

Capitalise school years, unless they‚Äôre plural. And use digits, not words.\

*Emoji*

We can use emoji in captions. We just don‚Äôt overdo it.

If an emoji comes at the end of a caption, just let it sit at the end without any other punctuation. See **Punctuation:** *Full stops* for more info about using full stops at the end of captions. (Hint: We don‚Äôt use them.)

If an emoji comes at the start of a sentence and is working as a word, the word following it continues in lower-case (so, with no initial capital).

If you‚Äôre putting an emoji between two sentences in a caption, it replaces the terminating mark of the first sentence. Start the second sentence with a capital letter.\

An emoji can replace a word (or come between two words) in the middle of a sentence, and we don‚Äôt put punctuation around it. In this way, it‚Äôs conveying a feeling or standing in for a word in the middle of other words, so we treat it as another word. Just don‚Äôt overdo it.\
Give us a ‚ù§Ô∏è for the bush and a üëç for the city.

*Numbers*

Spell out numbers to nine and use numerals for 10 and up.\
Somehow we managed to cut this list to just five.\

Watch our 60-second test

Add commas to numbers of four numerals or more.\
Of those, only 3,500 were bought by women.

Use numerals when referring to currency, either colloquially or formally.\
You want 20 bucks?\
That‚Äôs $4.95, for you.

Use numerals for specific times of day. Use a full stop to separate hours and minutes, not a colon, and sit the lower-case time unit flush at the end. Write out times when you‚Äôre using a term or phrase such as ‚Äòo‚Äôclock‚Äô, ‚Äòin the morning‚Äô or ‚Äòhalf past‚Äô.\
4\.30am\
That‚Äôs not what you want to hear at two in the morning.\
Meet us at half past one.

Spans of model years take the century on first instance and then only two digits of the year (unless the span crosses centuries: 1998‚Äì2002). The year span usually sits before a brand and model name. It only sits after if the span is in brackets (and this normally only happens in the blog titles, which we don‚Äôt write, or the Facebook post leads that basically follow said blog titles).\

Use numerals to show decades, rather than spelling them out, and use an apostrophe to show the missing century. Show that the decade is plural by adding the letter s.\

*Tagging*

Tag Australian car brands wherever possible. Tag the international brand if an Australian one isn‚Äôt available.

**Punctuation**

*Apostrophes*

Submit all blog post copy with curly apostrophes, not straight.

But use straight apostrophes, not curly, in Facebook captions. They‚Äôre the platform‚Äôs default, so we may as well work with it.

*Colons*

In Facebook caption link headlines, use a colon to separate category titles from subtitles. Don‚Äôt capitalise the first word after the colon‚Äîexcept in reviews, which are mostly car and brand names, anyway.\

*Ellipses*

On Facebook, use three full stops (which is easier than copying and pasting the glyph all the time). Don‚Äôt add a space before it, but add a space after.\
All they have to do now is automate the getting-petrol-into-the-tank part...

*Full stops*

We don‚Äôt use full stops on the final sentence in a Facebook caption, no matter whether the caption is one, two or three sentences long.

Don‚Äôt use full stops in acronyms and initialisms.\
You only get AM on the car radio now.\
Over in the US

*Dashes*

Use spaced en dashes for textual dashes ‚Äì in blog posts and in Facebook captions.

*Quotation marks*

Use curly quotation marks, not straight, in blog posts.

Use straight quotation marks, not curly, in Facebook captions. They‚Äôre the platform‚Äôs default, so we may as well work with it.

Use double quotation marks for all direct speech ‚Äì that is, anything someone has written or said.

Use single quotation marks for anything being defined or flagged as a special term. Don‚Äôt overdo this, though, or else we stray into scare quote territory.
