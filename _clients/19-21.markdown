# 19-21

# Style sheet

**What is 19-21?**\
19-21 is a collaborative workspace. It’s home to some of the best and brightest media and digital businesses in Melbourne.

**Tone of voice**\
‘We’ or removed voice of 19-21? Think about socials, friendliness, all comm channels.

* You’re welcome to book the space

* 19-21 is …

* We share bathrooms …

The people who rent space or desks at 19-21 are tenants, not renters or freelancers or hot-deskers or anything like that.

**Formatting**

*Capitalisation*

Use min caps (aka ‘sentence case’) for all headings on the site: page headings, collection headings and subheadings.

In copy, use as few capital letters as possible – that is, don’t make a generic noun into a proper noun unless it’s really, actually necessary. Generic is best!

*Contact names and details*

In a sentence, add an email address or a phone number in parentheses after a person’s name.

* Please get in touch with Ammar (ammar@rooftopcinema.com.au) to make a booking.

*Numbers*

Use simple phone numbers, without international codes. So: four-three-three digit numbers.

* Ammar (0402 844 617)

Spell out to nine and use numerals from 10.

**Punctuation**

*Apostrophes*

In all contexts other than social media, use curly apostrophes (’) instead of straight ones. Use straight ones (') on social media, because that’s the usual default and it looks silly to override them. Whatever platform you’re writing on, make sure your quote marks are consistent.

*Colons*

If a colon is part of a sentence, continue in sentence case after the colon – that is, no initial capital on the first word after the colon. But if you’re adding a ‘note’ like below, start the sentence following the colon with an initial capital.

* Note: The door automatically locks when it closes after you.

*Commas*

We don’t use the Oxford comma.

* keeping them neat, clean and tidy

*Dashes*

Our textual dashes are spaced ens.

* Please lock it behind you – by pressing the ‘lock’ button.

*Quote marks*

In all contexts other than social media, use curly quote marks (“” and ‘’) instead of straight ones. Use straight ones (" and ') on social media, because that’s the usual default and it looks silly to override them. Whatever platform you’re writing on, make sure your quote marks are consistent.

Use double quote marks around any written or spoken words. Follow Australian media style when you’re punctuating: keep punctuation inside the quote marks if your quote (usually a full sentence) has a carrier expression, and put it outside if you’re just dealing with a fragment.

* Carrier expression: “Dogs are the best,” he said.

* Fragment: He called dogs “the best”.

Use single quote marks around terms you’re flagging, naming or defining.

* Press the little ‘lock’ button.

* Our wi-fi network is called ‘Tether Locklear’.
